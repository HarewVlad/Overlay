# Overlay  
So basically focusing on making an injectable overlay, and also frame capturing of some sort, maybe something else ...  

# About  
1. Support Directx11
2. x64  
3. Can capture video (Not fully tested yet!)  
4. Can make screenshots  
5. You can eject it whenever you want  

# Build
Type in console the following:  
1. vcvars64  
2. build.bat  

It will produce 3 files: overlay.dll, injector.exe, overlay.exe  
You can use overlay.exe to debug something (devenv overlay.exe)
